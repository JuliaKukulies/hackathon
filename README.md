# Global Km-scale Hackathon @ NCAR

This repo contains a collection of notebooks being shared for the
NCAR Hackathon on global km-scale weather and climate model data.

### Science topics

* Storm tracking and development of atmospheric convection
* Cloud microphysics
* Land-atmosphere interactions (e.g. impact of soil moisture on precipitation, etc) and Hydrology applications (e.g. how to use the output from a km-scale climate model to drive a hydrological model)
* Extreme weather events
* Mesoscale circulations (e.g., land-sea breezes)
* Diurnal cycle (of convection/precipitation, shallow-to-deep transition)
* General circulation & upscale effects (Hadley Circulation, Lorenz energy cycle, and the effects of weather systems and deep convection on the large-scale circulation such as jetstreams)

### Additional folders

**basics/** contains example notebooks on how to access and read in the datasets

**observations/** contain some examples on the observational datasets that can be used for the analysis.
